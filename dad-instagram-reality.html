I basically live in this aisle of the supermarket now. New parents seem to gravitate to me as an "experienced parent" (i.e. the tired looking guy shivering in the corner) and ask "do you know where so and so is please?" My reponse - "Sure 3rd shelf, half way down on the left hand side, buy 3 & get a discount,although you want to use that in combination with blah blah blah." I'm like a walking encyclopaedia of baby product info. I used to use my brain to solve global corporate wide problems.

The 2 confidence tricksters are known in the local area and ply their trade by pretending to love their victims and then, when their guard is down, scratching their faces to pieces, pulling their hair and dribbling on them until they are given milk or rice cakes. The suspects are described as looking exactly the same, to the degree that their father cant tell them apart. They are around 2.5 ft tall, talk with a strange accent and are incredibly cute.

And by style I mean dealing with a huge melt down, an explosive poo that happened against my chest in the carrier literally 2 seconds after this photo was taken (and no nappies) and spending Â£8 on chips that were luke warm. It was all worth it to see the twins faces when the fireworks started.

I guess the eldest 2 like it as it's like a cheap version of the sea life centre. They get to watch these weird pink slippery things splash about and generally contort themselves out of these chairs while sucking the life out of some sponges. Clemmie and I are there just play life guards and crowd control. I should charge admission. Just avoid the dirty nappies at the door and the water EVERYWHERE. Actually, forget it - Health and safety would definitely shut us done. #waterstaysinthebathgirls #bathtime #sealifecentreathome #cheapentertainment #twins #mygirls #theyneverstayinthesechairs #fatherofdaughters #dadlife #instadad</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by Simon, also known as FOD (@father_of_daughters) on Oct 3, 2016 at 1:11pm PDT</p></figure><p>Being a dad is super friggin' tough, but once that kid smiles up at you or gives you a hug out of nowhere, you forget all the sleepless nights you went through.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">More from Distractify&amp;#xA0;</h2><p><a href=#><u>12 People Whose Lives Were Shook by 23AndMe</u></a></p><p><a href=#><u>Here Are Some Wedding Guests Who Decided to âSpeak Nowâ Rather Than âForever Hold Their Peaceâ</u></a></p><p><a href=#><u>12 Super Dark Childrens Show Moments That Were Utterly Traumatizing</u></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKCloryze5FpaG9nYWZ8coSOk2hyh2KAxnCwwJ1koqajqa6ovsCmZKudkaG2tcU%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./zuri-tibby-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Zuri Tibby - Age, Family, Bio</a>
