The two drove the taxi in turns. It was while driving the taxi in Mombasa that Akothee met a French diplomat who was impressed by her. The French diplomat was more curious to know if Akothee had just had a baby as she had a milk stain on her bosom. She told him the truth and the man felt sorry for her. He took down her contacts and invited himself to her home. Akothee introduced him to her young family and he then invited them to West Africa where he was working. Akothee admits that this man helped her financially. He offered to expand her taxi business, and she took the opportunity to venture into the tour operation business. While she was with this man, she managed to open a bar, The Stomp 196 in Shanzu, and he bought her the first van in Akothee Safaris. They moved to Switzerland but she felt that Akothee wedding this man was not going to happen and the man only wanted kids from her, pushing her to move back to Kenya when she was 9 months pregnant. She came back to Kenya and started her music career.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/c47d91fa53f33c9c.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Photo of Hellen Obiri's Hubby, Daughter Warmly Hugging Her after Winning Marathon Melts Hearts: "Amazing"</span></p></a><h2>Akothee net worth</h2><p class=align-left>Akothee net worth for the year 2017-2018 is approximately 6.2 billion Kenyan shillings. This was revealed by her manager Nelly Oaks in order to silence rumors that Akothee was worth 300 million Kenyan shillings. Akothee’s net worth can be attributed to her assets in Kenya which are worth about 1 billion Kenyan shillings. Moreover, Akothee’s net worth may be so large due to her businesses such as the Akothee Safaris tour company and the Morning Star Diani establishment which seeks to provide five-star comfort at three-star prices. Her career in music also has something to do with Akothee’s high net worth. Akothee once disclosed that she charges 1 million Kenyan shillings for a collaboration with an artist for a song. She paid Flavour 6 million for their collaboration on the ‘Give It To Me’ song, and she reportedly paid Tanzanian Diamond Platnumz 1.7 million for their collaboration on ‘Sweet Love’.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/47c96a5094846797.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Tahidi High Actress Boera Weds Actor in Colourful Wedding Graced by Cleophas Malala</span></p></a><h2>Akothee houses</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/e7da2934a2056fe4.jpeg><p class=align-left>Akothee owns a couple of luxury houses.

This was revealed by her manager, Nelly Oaks, who confirmed that the Kenyan songstress was bedridden for the fourth time in seven months now. The cause of her illness is the stress she has been receiving from her relatives whom she graciously took in. They have been stealing from her and causing her employees distress as well. The illness has cost her quite a lot, as just last week, Akothee had to cancel a show she had scheduled in the United States of America. We cannot even begin to imagine the financial damage brought about by this. But, hey, this is Akothee, and as she says, when she is beaten down, she rises to the occasion.</p><p class=align-left>Akothee revealed her disappointment in a long social media post,</p>“ It's not the platform to share my pain, but it's also good to share some life experiences… I promised myself never to live with relatives after so many disappointments, but hey I am human too, so 3 years ago, I decided to live with one of my cousins and a son of my neighbor whom I educated without any difficulty of school fees. When results came, none of them wanted to share with me, they had failed terribly! But hey its fine, failure in education is not failure in life…”<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/9dc2d6957c6e5996.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Keroche Heiress Arnelisa Muigai Thrilled after Business Meeting with President William Ruto: "I Feel Blessed"</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Akothee, who says that she is grateful that her kids have never given her so much trouble, then continues to say,</p>“They(Akothee kids) have never made me shed a tear of dissatisfaction or disappointment," she said.

This makes me happy. So why are peoples children sending me to hospitals? Why am I working extremely hard for ungrateful people! Why am I saaaad for the pregnancy and the labour pains that I dint bare! Why are relatives causing me so much pain! Is it because I am stupid? Do I owe them something!
