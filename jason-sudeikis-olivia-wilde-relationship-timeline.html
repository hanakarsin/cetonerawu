served with custody papers.</p><p>Before presenting the trailer of her sophomore feature film, <a href=#>Don’t Worry, Darling</a>, a spectator handed a cryptic manila envelope labeled "personal and confidential" to Olivia, which contained legal documents from her former fiancé, <a href=#>Jason Sudeikis</a>. If you're hoping to get more insight into the current drama, here is a complete timeline of their long-term relationship.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">May 2011: Jason Sudeikis and Olivia Wilde meet at an 'SNL' wrap party.</h2><p>Both recently divorced and single, Jason and Olivia first met at the Saturday Night Live Season 36 wrap party. Regarding the encounter, Jason <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">told Stephen Colbert in 2017</a> that he "came off looking a lot cooler" than he really is because mutual friends informed him she was dating someone. As a result, he didn't "make any sort of moves" until months later.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">November 2011: The famous pair officially start dating.</h2><p>Nearly six months after their initial meeting, Jason's busy schedule cleared up and Olivia stopped seeing someone else.

During an appearance on <a href=#>Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen</a>, a viewer asked when they were getting married.</p><p>"I know this isn’t my mom because my mom’s in the audience,” Jason quipped via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us Weekly</a>. "I mean, I believe we won’t get married until weed is legal in every state, gosh darn it!”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">May 2016: Olivia sports a baby bump at the Met Gala.</h2><p>On April 18, Olivia took to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> to announce she was pregnant with her and Jason's second child.</p><p>The actress posted a photo of her and Otis holding their bellies, with the caption that read, "Matching baby bumps." A few weeks later, Olivia arrived at the 2016 Met Gala and posed on the carpet with her fellow pregnant friend, <a href=#>Emily Blunt</a>.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">October 2016: Jason and Olivia welcome their second child, Daisy Sudeikis.</h2><p>On Oct. 11, 2016, Olivia gave birth to her and Jason's second child, a daughter named Daisy.

The film, which garnered <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">critical acclaim</a>, was Olivia's directorial debut. Additionally, Jason played a part in the movie, starring as Principal Jordan Brown.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">November 2020: The couple end their seven-year engagement amidst rumors that Olivia Wilde cheated on Jason.</h2><p>Then in 2020, we all learned that love isn't real.</p><p>On Nov. 13, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> reported that Jason and Olivia ended their seven-year engagement. A source close to the pair revealed that "the split happened at the beginning of the year," and they quickly "transitioned into a great co-parenting routine."</p><p>Since then, Olivia has been dating English singer and actor <a href=#>Harry Styles</a>. The pair met while filming Olivia's second feature film, Don't Worry, Darling, and many have speculated that Olivia cheated on Jason with Harry. <a href=#>According to sources</a>, co-star <a href=# style=text-align:start>Florence Pugh</a> was bothered by "seeing Olivia and Harry all over each other on set ... as Olivia was still with Jason when she first hooked up with Harry."</p><p>As for Jason, he's been dating his Horrible Bosses 2 and <a href=#>Ted Lasso</a> co-star Keeley Hazel since 2021.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">April 2022: Olivia Wilde is served child custody papers while on stage at CinemaCon.</h2><p>While promoting Don't Worry, Darling at CinemaCon on April 26, an individual approached the stage and slid a manila envelope marked "personal and confidential" toward Olivia.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>After asking if it was for her, the 38-year-old director looked over the paperwork before resuming her presentation. The following day, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deadline</a> reported the mysterious envelope contained custody papers from her former fiancé. Olivia and Jason had been arguing about where to permanently raise their kids, with him wanting to settle in New York and Olivia wanting to relocate to London to be closer to Harry Styles.</p><p>According to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Los Angeles Times</a>, Jason was furious with the spectacle.</p><p>"Mr. Sudeikis had no prior knowledge of the time or place that the envelope would have been delivered as this would solely be up to the process service company involved," reads a statement provided to the Los Angeles Times. "He would never condone her being served in such an inappropriate manner."</p><p>However, Olivia appears to believe the action was intentional. In court documents obtained by the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Mail</a> in August 2022, Olivia said, "Jason's actions were clearly intended to threaten me and catch me off guard. He could have served me discreetly, but instead he chose to serve me in the most aggressive manner possible."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn660u81mqq6clZ64qr%2BMqKOirpmWeri1y52cZqqVoa61tc6nqqGhoGLBqrnEpaCnnQ%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./rihanna-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Rihanna - Age, Family, Bio</a>
