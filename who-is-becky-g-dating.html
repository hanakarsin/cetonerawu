I‚Äôm so proud of you.

Although still so young, 27 is going to be a special year for you and the man you‚Äôre becoming. The journey of self discovery is never ending.

Their relationship wasn't very long-lived, and it probably didn't help that after confirming his relationship with Becky G, Austin completely denounced his two-year relationship with ex Camila Cabello.&nbsp;</p><p>When Austin confirmed their relationship in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MTV</a>, he said that Becky was his first "real relationship." Camila obviously didn't appreciate the comment, tweeting "D--n ‚Ä¶ good to know," right after the singer made the comment. Becky G and Fifth Harmony are close, so the comment likely rubbed Becky the wrong way ‚Äî and we don't blame her.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecisZJudk6DGbrOMnZitoZ6c</p></div><div id=links><a href=./why-is-paul-newman-on-salad-dressing.html>&#171;&nbsp;Why Is Paul Newman on Salad Dressing?
