Tupac</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/fc1a046b081e3627.jpeg><p class=align-left>Who is the best rapper in 2021? Tupac Amaru Shakur is considered the greatest rapper of all time. Before his death on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">13th September 1996</a>, Tupac Shakur was undoubtedly the greatest rapper at that time. Two decades later, people still sing to his praises.</p><p class=align-left>One reason is that he always addressed contemporary social issues in his songs. He has sung about inequality, and the community saw him as a symbol of resistance. For a rapper who was in the industry for only five years, he had a massive influence on society. Also, he had great mic skills and an excellent flow of music.</p><h3>2. The Notorious B.I.G.</h3><p class=align-left>When he released <i>Ready to Die </i>as his debut album in 1994, Christopher George Latore Wallace, also known as The Notorious B.I.G, became the central figure in USA hip-hop. It was on the East Coast where many people considered him the great.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/59fbdbad891a85da.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>List of 20 best Memphis rappers you should watch in 2022</span></p></a><p class=align-left>His visibility increased further to the West Coast despite the latter dominating the mainstream. Biggie had a short but remarkably influential career in hip-hop. Over two decades later after his death, many in the hip-hop industry still hold the opinion that he was the greatest of them all.</p><h3>3. Eminem</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/1228f7e7b7adfef3.jpeg><p class=align-left>Marshall Bruce Mathers III professionally known as Eminem is one of the best rappers right now. People regard him as one of the best because of his influence on hip-hop and society in general.</p><p class=align-left>His lyrics tell stories and capture the emotions of his fans. Eminem is the risk-taker. He plays the villain and is too political. But can manage his fanbase and personal views expertly. And if there is one thing that puts him at the top is that he can rap with even the best of them all.</p><h3>4. Kendrick Lamar</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/59fbdbad891a85da.jpeg><p class=align-left>Kendrick Lamar Duckworth is among the<a href=#> best rappers.</a> He ranks high because of his skill in writing and recording hip-hop songs.

The Blueprint album, for example, showed he is a top-notch rapper with the ability to produce fresh-sounding beats that have an incredible flow.</p><h3>6. Nas</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/a798dec1164163f6.jpeg><p class=align-left>Which rappers are the best right now? Nasir bin Olu Dara Jones professionally known as Nas is one of the best. Commercially, Nas is one of the few rappers that have released eight consecutive platinum and multi-platinum albums.</p><p class=align-left>However, that is not the only thing that makes him among the best.

In 2009, Drake signed with Lil Wayne’s music label Young Money Entertainment. Today, many people are of the view that he has surpassed Wayne and many other top artists as the best of them all.</p><p class=align-left>Furthermore, it is undeniable that Drake has been hip-hop’s number one trendsetter ever since he joined the scene in 2009. Commercially, Drake is one of the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">top-selling male artists</a> in the USA despite being a Canadian.</p><h3>8. Lil Wayne</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/eb9e4acdefbcb6e0.jpeg><p class=align-left>Ever since he rose to stardom, Dwayne Michael Carter Jr, professionally known as Lil Wayne, always branded himself as the best hip-hop rapper alive. That can be true because he is one of the few rappers that had their albums certified platinum at the age of 17.</p><p class=align-left>Perhaps one of the reasons he deserves such a title is because of his thoughtful and clever lyricism. Instead of writing lyrics, Wayne prefers spitting his verses from his head and has never gone wrong.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/2998d4a76c08a27a.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 best black male stand-up comedians of all time</span></p></a><h3>9.

But for the greatest rappers of all time, nobody can ignore Calvin Cordozar Broadus Jr. From his classical albums, you can tell each of his hip-hop <a href=#>songs</a> have a fantastic flow and follow a specific theme. His delivery on every track outshines even the structured of lyrics. Also, Snoop Dogg is one of the sharpest concept pushers and a fantastic storyteller.</p><h3>10. Rakim</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/3bf9fccc13bb6336.jpeg><p class=align-left>When people debate about the greatest rapper of all time, William Michael Griffin Jr, professionally known as Rakim, always appears on the list. But is Rakim the greatest rapper of all time? He is probably the greatest rapper of his generation. That is because the American rapper entered the scene during the golden age of hip-hop.</p><p class=align-left>It was a time when there were many hip-hop heavyweights like LL Cool J, Public Enemy, and Big Daddy Kane, among others. For Rakim, the best way of outperforming them was to come up with a unique flow and style. He also sounded technical and looked lyrically superior. At that time, many rappers never wanted to go beyond their traditional rhyme scheme.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/fbcfd3e8d0bd94e7.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 greatest black opera singers of all time</span></p></a><h3>11.
