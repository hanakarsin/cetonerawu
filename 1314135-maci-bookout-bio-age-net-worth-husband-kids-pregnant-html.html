Her Instagram bio reads:</p>Author/Poetry Enthusiast...Mom of 3 & Wife...Proud Red Head.<h2>Maci Bookout quotes</h2><ul><li>"The more you take care of the good things in your life, the longer they stick around, and the better they become. The more you persevere in the face of doubt and discouragement, the stronger you become. The harder you work for the things you want, the more they mean to you when you find them." -<i> Bulletproof</i></li><li>"Relationships are work, but they do not just work. It shouldn't feel like a constant stream of chores and problems. You have to be business partners, parenting partners, and sex partners, but you also have to be friends. Never forget how important it is just to like each other. Spend time bonding and making each other laugh. Always leave room for friendship between you. You can always still love somebody, but once you don't like them anymore, that's when you're in trouble."</li><li>If you sit around and think about how s***ty things are, all that happens is that things stay s***ty. I didn't have time for that. Why waste that energy? When life throws something unexpected in your path, the only useful thing to do is figure out how to get over, under, around or through it the best way you can."</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/2afbc05d7b5f1e0b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top facts about Washington Times columnist Madison Gesiotto</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Maci Bookout has defied the odds of being a teenage mom, she has risen to become one of the most famous reality TV personalities in the world, and her story is one that definitely needs to be read.</p><p></p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkfnR9k2pqbmWdlrCqecGopqSnpal6o7XOZpignV2jsrV51qipraBdncK0rsCnm2ajmZnAbrzRnp6nmZ6pe6nAzKU%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./ibrahim-suleiman.html>&#171;&nbsp;Read All The Latest News About Ibrahim Suleiman On Naija News</a>
