Even before Kenya gained independence, there were calls for a regional system (majimbo) that would ensure equal distribution of powers. However, when the ruling party took over, it favored the Provincial Administration system under the central government.

From the need for equal distribution of resources and powers to public participation, here are some of the advantages of decentralization in Kenya</p><h3>Supports Economic and Social Growth</h3><p class=align-left>With the devolved systems, it is easier to achieve growth both at national and county development. As county headquarters and centers develop, new opportunities for employment and investments arise paving the way for more significant progress. Currently, county governments are implementing growth strategies that aim at improving the living standards of its people. Early 2018, Makueni county launched its Universal Health System to make affordable care achievable in the area.</p><h3>Equitable Distribution of Resources</h3><p class=align-left>Previously, most of the resources including public institutions were in the major urban centers and cities. But, with devolution, each county has equal chances of growth as the share of resources is equal.</p><h3>Diversity and Inclusion</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/f4b21416f214af26.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Only Military Can Effectively Manage Kenya Power, Lawyer Donald Kipkorir</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Today, all people including the marginalized and minorities can reap the benefits of self-governance and manage their development and affairs.</p><h3>National Unity</h3><p class=align-left>By reducing the power of the central government and distributing it equally among the counties, the devolved systems hopes to achieve national unity.</p><h3>Democracy and Accountability</h3><p class=align-left>People at the grassroots get to choose their leaders and directly participate in decision-making processes making room for accountability and democracy.</p><h3>Informed Decision Making</h3><p class=align-left>Decisions made at county level focus more on the local needs.</p><h2>Disadvantages of Devolution in Kenya</h2><p class=align-left>While devolution has had its pros, Kenyans have also witnessed its shortcomings. Some of the weaknesses of decentralization are</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/64a9af60340d930c.jpeg><h3>It is expensive</h3><p class=align-left>The introduction of more seats (67 senators, 47 governors and 2,526 member of assemblies) means that the taxpayer is at a loss since the wage budget increased significantly.</p><h3>Non-uniform Development</h3><p class=align-left>Some counties such as Nairobi, Nakuru, and Mombasa, already had a head start development wise. These counties have better infrastructure and public utilities as well as opportunities for employment and investment. It will take extra efforts and some years for other counties to catch up.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/35bd0a0f8fd9415f.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 major BBI proposals that you need to know about before the referendum</span></p></a><h3>Duplication of roles</h3><p class=align-left>Currently, more people are doing the same job. Therefore, the chances of misusing powers and wasting resources are higher. Beginning 2014 to 2016, Kenya witnessed a lot of back and forth between the National Assembly and the Senate. For some, it is hard to distinguish between the role of the senators and the MPs.</p><h3>Mismanagement of funds</h3><p class=align-left>Some county governments have been in the spotlight for misappropriating funds while most counties cannot account for the money allocated.</p><h2>Challenges Facing Devolution in Kenya</h2><p class=align-left>Even with the several positive impacts of devolution in Kenya, several problems inhibit its implementation fully. Some of the challenges include</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> 13 things Kenyans regret about marriage</p><h3>The rough transition processes</h3><p class=align-left>Over the last couple of years, Kenyans have been spectators in the pull-and-push between the National and county governments regarding the mandates of both and allocation of resources. Sometime back, the Council of Governors pointed an accusing finger at the state for derailing the transition process. As the two lock horns, service delivery at county level becomes affected. When the counties took over health docket, there has been a go-slow in the services offered and strikes lasting months. Some analysts think that the transition process is to blame for the problem.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/f650daa570bf4f0d.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Chief Administrative Secretaries in Kenya 2020</span></p></a><h3>Human Resources gaps</h3><p class=align-left>What is the point of having resources, when the people in charge cannot manage? Well, this is the problem facing most of the counties. In fact, the hiring process of county executives and other officials is questionable. Some county governments seem to be rewarding allies, rather than appointing professionals to get the job done.</p><h3>Lack of resources and capacity for efficient service delivery</h3><p class=align-left>The county governments have a problem in the management of current resources. As it is, salaries and wages account for a significant portion of the county budgets. Therefore, compromising other development efforts.</p><h3>Fiscal Challenges</h3><p class=align-left>While the National and county legislature oversees the budgeting process, the National Treasury still has a lot of power and control over the fiscal policy. The county governments have not yet come up with systems or measures to handle county treasury operations.</p><p class=align-left>Inclusion is still a problem</p><p class=align-left>Ethnicity still plays a major role in securing votes and representation in the counties. Some minority communities in areas such as Migori, Turkana, Garissa, Bungoma and Samburu feel left out. Also, the participation of special groups such as the disabled, youth and women has not increased significantly as a result of devolution.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/fec2d782ab5ec936.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What is the work of DCI in Kenya?</span></p></a><h3>Revenue Allocation</h3><p class=align-left>The 15% of National revenue allocated to counties may not be enough to enable them to discharge all their duties. While some counties such as Nairobi and Kiambu collect a lot of revenues, the resources are still not enough for efficient service delivery. However, the counties need to be more accountable before they receive extra funding from the government.</p><p class=align-left>Kenyans look to county governments to drive the desired change in the country. While some counties such as Makueni are in the forefront, some are still lagging behind.</p><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnB%2BlW1qb2pdmLWiuMuepaCdo2Kzoq%2FIp55mnJWrvK3B06Kmp2Wbmru6rY2hq6ak</p></div><div id=links><a href=./chris-robinson-soapactor-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Chris Robinson (Soap Opera Actor) - Age, Family, Bio</a>
