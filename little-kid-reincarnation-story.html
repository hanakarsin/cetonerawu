And with the rise of social media, folks all over the world can showcase the thought-provoking and sometimes hilarious commentary their children share.</p><p>With that in mind, we all can agree that children have vivid imaginations. Some kids love to discuss their <a href=#>imaginary friends</a>, lifestyles, and even in some cases, families.</p><p>In a viral <a href=#>TikTok</a> video, one mother said that her little kid had a <a href=#>reincarnation story</a> — and the details may seem a little too specific for a child to come up with.</p><p>So, what gives? Can we chock this up to the child having a wild imagination, or is this legit?

In an April 2023 TikTok video, creator <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ashley (@2kidsmamadrama)</a> shared an intriguing tale about her daughter, who claimed she was reincarnated.</p><p>“My old soul, little old lady daughter recounts her past life and how she died. Mind you, she’s older now so details are fading but she doesn’t ever skip a beat and remembers the same things every time,” the caption reads.</p><p>As the video starts, Ashley is sitting down as she begins the story.</p><p>“When she was 5 years old, she said ‘Let’s pretend that you’re my real mom,’” Ashley recalled. “I was like, ‘I am your real mom, biologically.’”</p><p>“She’s like, ‘No, silly, you’re my new mom, my real mom died a long time ago. And then I came back and now you’re my new mom,’” Ashley went on.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@2kidsmamadrama href=#>@2kidsmamadrama</a><p>My old soul, little old lady daughter recounts her past life and how she died.

It hit the daughter’s side and killed her and her mother. The dad was driving.</p><p>Ashley said she made it a point to remember these details by typing them in her phone, so that she could later catch later her daughter in a lie. But it turns out the details held up.</p><p>A year later when Ashley asked her daughter (who was around 8, it seems) about the details, the girl recalled pretty much everything she'd said a year prior.</p><p>“I died in 1942 in a car accident. We were turning when a car hit my side of the car. And me and my mother died, my father, brother, and sister lived,” Ashley recalled her daughter saying.</p><p>Ashley asked her daughter why they weren't wearing seatbelts and her daughter explained that there were no seatbelts back then.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@2kidsmamadrama href=#>@2kidsmamadrama</a><p>Replying to @nancymiller0020 update to her reincarnation story!
