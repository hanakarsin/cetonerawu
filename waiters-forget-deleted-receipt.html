"I'm a plaid a**hole" and "I have a small p***s" were put on there by the wait-staff to obviously mock the customers, who, according to The Washington Post, didn't really do much to invoke the ire of the restaurant's employees.&nbsp;</p><p>Turns out it was a simple conversation about bowls, of all things.</p><p>See, Peter Chang is billed as an "authentic" Sichuan dining experience. It was restaurant was opened by a former <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chinese embassy chef</a> of the same name who is now a successful restaurateur.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Nhat Thanh Đa (@skipwyth)</a></p></figure><p>The party of four each ordered rice, and whenever there are three are more guests, Chang's policy is to serve the rice in a single, family style bowl (probably to avoid clutter on the table and reduce the amount of dishes to clean). To one of the patrons, who was formerly a Beijing resident, this seemed kind of strange as in their experience in China, the rice was all brought out in individual bowls.</p><p>The waiter than asked if they wanted their rice put in individual bowls, but everyone at the table insisted no that it's fine - that it was only brought up because that was the diner's experience in China. One of the diners told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Washington Post</a> that there was a palpably awkward moment that got even more awkward once the check came.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: peter chang</span></figure><p>The group's table asked that the check be split four ways, to which the waiter responded, "That's totally how they do it in China." One of the diners who spoke with The Washington Post, Matt, said that he didn't understand what the passive aggressive comment meant until his friend, the Beijing Resident, informed him.</p>"In China, one person pays for it. That's not at all the way things are done in China, so she's being sarcastic."<p>That's right, they allegedly got sass from the waitstaff, which was all but confirmed once the receipt came with the mean comments.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: tripadvisor</a></figure><p>The location's manager, Qian Cheng, reportedly brushed off the plaid-wearing customer's concerns at first, chalking the receipt comments as being a joke between staff members that should've been deleted before being presented to the table.</p><p>Cheng gave them a $20 gift card for the incident. Then cut back the server's hours, not allowing them to work on weekends, which is precious tip time.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Nick Scrio (@nickscrin)</a></p></figure><p>Well, also, real tips too, not just the pearls of wisdom like that one above.</p><p>After The Washington Post reached out for comment, however, Peter Chang restaurant issued this following response.&nbsp;</p>I sincerely apologize to the guests who were offended on 05/07/2016 when they dined at my Arlington restaurant. I am deeply disturbed by the incident. I am sorry, my respected guests. I also apologize to all my friends who have had trust in Peter Chang. We made a mistake and let you down.&nbsp;We made a mistake and we must correct it. The following is what we are doing to correct and improve:&nbsp;1. My company has fired Qian Cheng, the manager on duty on 05/07, and the waiter and waitress on duty. Manager Lydia Zhang will also be fired after the investigation is completed.2. My company is contacting a professional management company and will have it as our consultant in improving the management of all the restaurants in my company. My goal is to enforce discipline, supervision of all employees and to better the training of services [sic] so as to build a managing team that is professional and effective, so that the quality of services will be guaranteed.3. My company will make greater effort in improving the food quality monitoring system so my insistence on offering fresh and healthy food with Chinese characteristics will not only be upheld but improved and perfected.4. We accept guests’ complaints and/or criticism wholeheartedly. Please call Gen Lee, who is one of the founders of my company, by dialing (434) 227-0006 if you are unsatisfied with any aspect of my restaurants. He will contact you quickly.Dear guests and friends, I found dignity in being a chef due to your support and encouragement. I need more of your help in supervising my employees, so my restaurants will be nicer places for you to enjoy fine food in the future, and I will have a stage to continue to present my culinary skills.-Peter Cheng<p>And who would've thunk that all of this drama was started by a few measly bowls?</p><p>Well, don't count on receipt drama ending any time soon - it's a long and storied tradition.
