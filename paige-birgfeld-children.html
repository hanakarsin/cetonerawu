Jess left several voicemails on the night her mother went missing, begging her to come home. She was 17 when she testified for Jones' trial, calling her mother a "soccer mom" who would take her and her brothers, Taft Dixon and Kohl "Trigger" Dixon, to school and let them sleep in her bed.</p><p>As 20/20 prepares to look back on the mysterious double life of Paige Birgfeld, where are her children today?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Paige Birgfeld had three children with her ex-husband Rob Dixon.</h2><p>Birgfeld was a twice-divorced mother of three, who had her daughter and two sons in her second marriage to Rob Dixon. The two were married from 1998 to 2006, and their relationship was a troubling one. Birgfeld's brother believes that their financial situation played into the difficulties of their marriage.</p><p>In 2004, Birgfeld called the police to report that her husband had threatened that she would "come home and find [their children] all murdered."</p><p>A year later, she accused him of attacking her, leading to him being charged with third-degree assault. In the end, he pleaded guilty to misdemeanor harassment, though the charges would later be dismissed, and the couple would go on to divorce the following year.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Ultimately, Rob Dixon was cleared of speculation that he had to do with her disappearance and death due to the fact that he was living in Pennsylvania at the time. Birgfeld had vanished from Grand Junction, Colo.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Following their divorce, Birgfeld rekindled a relationship with her first husband, Ron Beigler, whom she divorced because she wanted children and he didn't. Though Beigler was one of the last people to see Birgfeld alive, he was also cleared of suspicion because he was near Denver when she was taken.</p><p>According to her family and friends, Birgfeld was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">devoted to her children</a> above all else. She worked numerous jobs, from teaching in a preschool dance business to selling high-end kitchen supplies to running an escort service, while her family was struggling under piles of bills, primarily brought on by Rob Dixon's reckless spending and risky business ventures.</p><p>Although Jess Dixon was 8 when her mother disappeared, her brothers were <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">even younger</a>.

Today, considering their ages when their mother was murdered, Jess Dixon would be 22, Taft Dixon 20, and Trigger Dixon 17.</p><p>Although they may have been raised by their father, as some reports suggest, it seems that the three would rather the public not know exactly where they are today. They are also now of an age where they are forging their own paths in life, as the youngest, Trigger, likely is graduating high school soon.</p><p>Catch 20/20 on May 21 at 9 p.m. EST on ABC to learn more about the disappearance and death of Paige Birgfeld.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpa6qs8RmmaKql5uyrbCMnJ%2BipJSnsq8%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./bailey-mcknight-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Bailey McKnight-Howard - Age, Family, Bio</a>
