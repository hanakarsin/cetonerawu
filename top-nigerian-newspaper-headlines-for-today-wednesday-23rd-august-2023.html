today, Wednesday, 23rd August 2023.</h2><p>Retired General Abdulsalami Abubakar, leading the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) delegation to Niger Republic, has conveyed optimism about a peaceful resolution to the recent coup, emphasizing dialogue over warfare.</p><p>Abubakar briefed reporters in Abuja on Tuesday after discussions at the Presidential Villa, presided by President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, the current ECOWAS Chairman.</p><p>The session also saw attendance from the ECOWAS Commission’s President, Dr Omar Touray, and the National Security Adviser, Malam Nuhu Ribadu.</p><p>Following his discussions with Niger’s deposed President, Mohamed Bazoum, and the junta’s leaders, Abubakar reported that he has passed on the stipulations of the Abdouramane Tchiani-led military regime to ECOWAS, marking the beginning of correspondence between the regional organization and Niger’s military.</p><p>He said the line of contact opened by ECOWAS through his appointment as envoy had been very fruitful, expressing hope that something concrete would soon come out of it.</p><p>The Presidency has said there is nothing like mismatched ministers in President Bola Tinubu’s cabinet, a day after their inauguration at the Presidential Villa in Abuja.</p><p>Naija News reports that the Presidential Spokesman, Ajuri Ngelale, stated this on Tuesday during an appearance on Channels Television’s Business Morning.</p><p>He was reacting to the criticisms that trailed the appointment of Festus Keyamo as the Minister of Aviation and Aerospace Development, and Gboyega Oyetola as the Minister of Marine and Blue Economy.</p><p>He acknowledged that Keyamo might never have flown a plane nor been a captain but has the legal knowledge to oversee any review of the regulations that will be undergirding the aviation sector.</p><p>He, however, argued that anyone who understands the aviation industry recognises the central role that policy and regulation play in the effective operation of that industry.</p><p>Former Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola has launched a new group within the All Progressives Congress (APC) known as the ‘Omoluabi’ caucus.</p><p>The former Governor of Osun State however said the new caucus is not a faction but a coming together of like-minded persons within the party in Osun State.</p><p>Members of the caucus were drawn from each ward of the 332 wards in the state and were represented by five members each from each of the local government areas in the state.</p><p>Naija News reports Aregbesola made this known in a statement issued on Tuesday by his media adviser, Sola Fasure.</p><p>The former Minister inaugurated the caucus in his hometown of Ilesa, Osun State on Tuesday while re-affirming his commitment to the APC, adding that he and others in the caucus have no plans to dump the party.</p><p>President Bola Ahmed Tinubu has directed the commencement of 90-day pre-retirement leave for the Director-General/CEO of the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC), Engr. Aliyu Abubakar Aziz.</p><p>Naija News reports that the retirement leave takes effect from August 24, 2023, leading to his eventual retirement from service on November 24, 2023.</p><p>This was made known in a statement on Tuesday by the Special Adviser to the President on Media & Publicity, Ajuri Ngelale.</p><p>The President also approved the appointment of Bisoye Coker-Odusote to serve as the Acting Director-General/CEO of the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) for a 90-day period.</p><p>Coker-Odusote’s appointment takes effect from August 24, 2023, after which, a full term of four years will begin as the substantive NIMC Director-General/CEO, beginning on November 24, 2023.</p><p>Furthermore, President Tinubu approved the appointment of Hon. Yusuf Buba Yakub to serve as the Director/CEO of the Directorate of Technical Aid Corps (DTAC).</p><p>This follows the recent expiration of tenure of the former DTAC Director/CEO, Dr. Pius Osunyikanmi.</p><p>The British Government has charged the former Minister of Petroleum in Nigeria, Diezani Alison-Madueke with bribery offences and fraud.</p><p>The UK’s National Crime Agency (NCA) said they suspected Diezani had accepted bribes in return for awarding multi-million-pound oil and gas contracts during his time as a minister in Nigeria.</p><p>In a statement published on its website on Tuesday, NCA said Diezani will appear at Westminster magistrates court on October 2, for the case.</p><p>Speaking about the charges, Head of the National Crime Agency’s (NCA) International Corruption Unit, Andy Kelly, said the charges against Alison-Madueke was brought after a thorough and complex international investigation.</p><p>Kelly said Alison-Madueke was accused of benefitting from at least £100,000 in cash, chauffeur-driven cars, flights on private jets, luxury holidays for her family, and the use of multiple London properties.</p><p>He added that the charges against the former minister also detail financial rewards including furniture, renovation work and staff for the properties, payment of private school fees, and gifts from high-end designer shops such as Cartier jewellery and Louis Vuitton goods.</p><p>The Federal Government, through the Ministry of Transportation, has proposed the reintroduction of mass transit schemes back into the Nigerian transport system.</p><p>Naija News gathered that the ministry is proposing introducing electric vehicles into the proposed mass transit scheme in the country.</p><p>According to the Minister of Transportation, Ahmed Alkali, there is an urgent need to bring the mass transit system back into the country, especially when the government has removed subsidy from fuel.</p><p>The minister, while resuming work on Tuesday in Abuja, said with the current surge in transportation fees around the country due to the subsidy removal, the ministry will focus on policies that will make room for cheaper transport for Nigerians.</p><p>He said he would collaborate with vital agencies and bodies to achieve that.</p><p>A 21-day ultimatum has been issued by medical practitioners, under the auspices of the Medical and Dental Consultants Association of Nigeria (MDCAN) to the Federal Government to meet its demands or face industrial disharmony.</p><p>Naija News gathered that MDCAN issued the ultimatum in a statement released by its President, Dr. Victor Makanjuola, and Secretary-General, Dr Yemi Raji at the end of its extraordinary National Executive Council meeting.</p><p>The NEC expressed dismay over the non-implementation of the jointly agreed upward review of CONMESS and the introduction of Accoutrement allowance with the Nigerian Medical Association, as the released circular only captured the percentage increase on the basic salary, as against applying it to both the basic salaries and all allowances except hazard allowance.</p><p>The council said it observed the non-universal implementation of CONMESS for all medical and dental doctors irrespective of the agencies of the government they are working with.</p><p>The council decried the failure of the government to appreciate the magnitude of the impacts of brain drain in the health sector, as exhibited by the refusal of the National Council on Establishment to approve the Federal Ministry of Health’s proposal on the upward review of the age of retirement for the Medical and Dental Consultants and other health workers.</p><p>The council said the government has failed to resolve the ongoing disputes with the National Association of Residents Doctors and its attendant impacts on access to health care by Nigerians, and the kidnapping of doctors in the country.</p><p>Nigeria’s First Lady, Remi Tinubu, on Tuesday, appealed to Nigerians to be patient over the current hardship following the removal of subsidy from Premium Motor Spirit (PMS), better known as fuel or petrol, saying there is always light at the end of the tunnel.</p><p>She said the administration of her husband, President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, mean well for the country.</p><p>Naija News understands that the First Lady stated this when she received Wives of Service Chiefs and the Inspector General of Police led by the wife of the Chief of Defence Staff and President, of the Defence and Police Wives Association, Mrs Oghogho Musa.</p><p>Mrs Tinubu, in a statement made available to newsmen by her spokesperson, Busola Kukoyi, encouraged Nigerians to look beyond the present situation in the country and see the bigger picture.</p><p>The First Lady assured the delegation that the Tinubu administration is doing everything possible to ensure that it cushions the effects of the fuel subsidy removal until the gains of the policy begin to materialize.</p><p>The National Assembly Elections Petition Tribunal sitting in Umuahia, Abia State on Tuesday upheld the victory of the Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, Benjamin Kalu at the polls.</p><p>The three-man panel of the tribunal in its ruling, dismissed the petition by the candidate of the Labour Party (LP), Frank Chinasa, seeking to nullify the electoral victory of Kalu.</p><p>The three judges of the panel in a unanimous judgment read by the tribunal chairman, Justice Samson Gang dismissed the Chinasa’s petition for lack of merit.</p><p>Naija News reports Kalu represents Bende federal constituency in the lower chamber of the National Assembly.</p><p>Naija News recalls the LP candidate had on March 17, 2023, approached the court through his petition seeking to nullify Kalu’s victory.</p><p>However, the tribunal panel on Tuesday held that it is within the right of the first respondent, (Kalu) to change his name as no person or group of persons has the monopoly of any name.</p><p>Justice Gang added that Kalu equally harmonized the names in his certificate and which was published in the federal government official gazette.</p><p>The Judge while dismissing the case for lack of merit noted that the petitioner failed to prove his case.</p><p>Niger Republic has been suspended from being part of the African Union (AU).</p><p>The suspension follows the ousting and continuous detention of democratically elected President Mohamed Bazoum by a military junta, Naija News reports.</p><p>In a statement issued on Tuesday, AU said the Republic of Niger is now suspended from all its activities, regretting the military coup on July 26, which has put the African country in crisis mode for weeks now.</p><p>The AU reiterated calls for the coup leaders to release Bazoum and return to their barracks.</p><p>The AU Peace and Security Council has taken note of the West African bloc ECOWAS’ decision to activate a
