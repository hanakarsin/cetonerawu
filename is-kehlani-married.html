Through her smooth singing voice, fans know intimate details about her childhood upbringing, being a member of the <a href=#>LGBTQIA community</a>, and <a href=#>romantic relationships</a>. The latter is something many discuss before Kehlani has a chance to do it herself.</p><p>Throughout her career, Kehlani, who uses she/they pronouns, has had several high-profile romances that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">dissolved in the public eye</a>. The 29-year-old mom of one has apparently learned from her past relationships and is now keeping everything off-limits, even a marriage and quickie divorce. Yep, you read that right.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Is Kehlani married?</h2><p>In July 2024, Kehlani celebrated the release of her new album, "Crash," and her debut performance on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NPR's Tiny Desk</a>. Elsewhere, the internet ran amuck after an X user revealed something the "After Hours" singer seemingly tried to keep under wraps. The creator claimed on July 31 that Kehlani has a history of entering ‚Äî and leaving ‚Äî relationships faster than most. The user also revealed Kehlani secretly married someone and divorced them just three months later to further prove their point.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>After finding out Kehlani was secretly married earlier this year to one of the producers of Cowboy Carter and then got it annulled after like 3 months‚Ä¶like that couldn‚Äôt have been that long after she split from the basketball coach gf.</p><p>idk, It‚Äôs giving she‚Äôs the problem. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/zIpYYoC444</a></p>‚Äî lil stallion (@jo___deci) <a href=#>July 31, 2024</a></figure><p>"After finding out Kehlani was secretly married earlier this year to one of the producers of "Cowboy Carter" and then got it annulled after like three months‚Ä¶like that couldn‚Äôt have been that long after she split from the basketball coach gf," the user wrote. "Idk, It‚Äôs giving she‚Äôs the problem."</p><p>The user's post received mixed messages in the comments. While some agreed Kehlani dates around, others were stunned to hear she was ever married for the first time, and many believed the user was spreading another social media fallacy.</p><p>Fortunately, the user wasn't lying about Kehlani's secret marriage. Distractify can confirm she was married to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mariel Gomerez</a> in mid-2024. The couple started dating after Kehlani's split from UCONN Women's Basketball Graduate Assistant <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kiara Russell</a>, and court records show they wed in Nevada on April 20. While Kehlani never confirmed the marriage, a TikTok user shared that her song, "Chapel," about the couple's Vegas nuptials.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@ariel_nomermaid href=#>@ariel_nomermaid</a><p>‚ÄúJust two gold rings and bootleg Elvis and my baby‚Äù NOOOOO üò≠ <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=kehlanitiktok href=#>#kehlanitiktok</a> <a title=kehlani href=#>#kehlani</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ Chapel - Kehlani" href=#>‚ô¨ Chapel - Kehlani</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Kehlani and her ex-wife annulled their marriage in June 2024.</h2><p>Kehlani's choice to keep their marriage to themselves was seemingly for the best. Almost three months before their private wedding, Kehlani's wife filed for divorce. According to Clark County court records reportedly obtained by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Media Takeout</a>, the couple's split came down to a mix of the "Distraction" singer's mental health and alleged infidelity.</p><p style=text-align:left>The docs show that Mariel attempted to get the marriage annulled in June 2024. Mariel stated in court that she married Kehlani "with the impression both Plaintiff and Defendant love each other." However, she said she learned in the marriage that she was "unaware" of Kehlani's true intentions, which Mariel claims was to "promote defendant's upcoming album."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Mariel also claimed the marriage was "obtained by fraud," stating Kehlani, who has been <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">open about her mental health</a>, admitted to Mariel she was "insane" when she agreed to marry her.</p><p>The singer allegedly thought she was "a character she made up," and Mariel believes her partner was "method acting" throughout their time together.</p><p>Additionally, Mariel said Kehlani "committed adultery," during their 3-month marriage, which further inspired her to part ways with the artist. The annulment complaint was dismissed by the court in June, and Kehlani and Mariel are reportedly still legally married.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Kehlani (@kehlani)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Kehlani's estranged wife, Mariel Gomerez, has yet to discuss their marrriage or divorce publicly.</h2><p>Kehlani's impending divorce hasn't stopped the singer from getting to the bag.
