The four have made an effort, while others have come close enough. Among these are teams which have been in the NFL for very long. The four are as follows:</p><h3>1. The Cleveland Browns</h3><p class=align-left>The <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Washington based team</a> was founded in 1946 but were <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">integrated into the NFL</a> in 1950. They won championships before the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">NFL merger</a> in 1966 and began to play in 1999. The Browns last appeared in the NFL playoffs in 2002. In 1996, the team's owner, Art Modell moved the team to Baltimore, and would later form the Baltimore Ravens.</p><p class=align-left>The Browns did not make it to the Super Bowl both before or after the expansion. However, the Baltimore Ravens, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">who left Cleveland</a> have won two Super Bowls. The Browns won only four of 48 games between 2015 and 2017.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/06a1ec51a1a33203.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Details of Proposed Champions League Format Which Will Feature 36 Teams Instead of 32</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO</strong>: Champions League: Chelsea could face Bayern, Inter Milan in group of death</p><h3>2. Detroit Lions</h3><p class=align-left>The team was founded in 1928 as the Portsmouth (Ohio) Spartans but <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">joined the NFL</a> on July 12, 1930. They have made it to only one conference championship game after the 1991 season.</p><p class=align-left>There have been two Super Bowls held in Detroit; Super Bowl XVI in Pontiac, Mich and Super Bowl XL in Detroit. Despite this, the Lions have not played even in a conference championship game since 1991.</p><p class=align-left>The last eight times Detroit has made the playoffs, it has lost every game. They finished 6-10 in 2019, after winning 36 games in the previous four seasons. What team hasn't been to the Super Bowl in 50 years? Detroit Lions, who are the oldest of these four squads.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/5edf880b5f1d0c6d.jpeg><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO</strong>: Ayodeji Sotona: Man United youngster completes Nice move</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/1e59750f31fba2f9.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Germany FA confirms departure of national team boss Joachim Low after Euro 2020</span></p></a><h3>3. Jacksonville Jaguars</h3><p class=align-left>The Jaguars began to play in 1995 <a id=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Jacksonville-Jaguars href=# rel="nofollow noopener">as an expansion team</a> alongside the Carolina Panthers of the National Football Conference. They have lost the AFC championship game three times. The most recent one was in 2017, where they fell to Tom Brady and the Patriots in the fourth quarter.</p><p class=align-left>The âJagsâ made it to the Conference championship three times, losing each. The first time they made it that far was in their second season when they defeated the Buffalo Bills and Denver Broncos by a 30-27 score. This was before they were defeated by the New England Patriots, 20-6.</p><p class=align-left>In 2017, the team had ten season wins and a division title. Jacksonville won its first two playoff games and had a 10-point lead in the fourth quarter of the AFC championship game. That is as close as the team came to the Super Bowl as it was denied its first appearance by a New England Patriotsâ win. The Jaguars dived back down the standings in 2018, finishing the season with a 5â11 record.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/f1c22fa096449361.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>20 of the longest winning streaks since the year 2000 as Man City place 3rd</span></p></a><h3>4. Houston Texans</h3><p class=align-left>The Texans were formerly known as Houston NFL. The <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">history of the team</a> dates back to 1997. However, it was not until 2002 that the team hit the field. In the same year, the team recorded their first pre-season win, defeating the New Orleans Saints 13-10.</p><p class=align-left>Houston Texans have lost three divisional playoff games in its five post-season appearances. They recorded a 22-19 win over the Buffalo Bills in the AFC wild-card round.</p><p class=align-left>They then advanced to the divisional round of the playoffs for the fourth time in team history. The team clinched their second AFC South Championship title and the fourth division title after beating Tampa Bay Buccaneers 23-20.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO</strong>: Cristiano Ronaldo becomes first footballer to score 450 goals in Europe</p><h2>What NFL team has never been to the playoffs?</h2><p class=align-left>As the annual season continues in anticipation of the final, playoffs are held between various crews.

However, some squads like the Detroit Lions and Arizona Cardinals went for about 20 years between playoff appearances.</p><h2>Teams without super bowl wins</h2><p class=align-left>Most game enthusiasts have been asking if there are NFL teams without a Super Bowl win. At the start of every season, every team in the NFL hopes to get to the finals and win. However, not all of them have made it to this coveted championship. Twelve NFL squads have not had a Super Bowl win.</p><p class=align-left>It is interesting to note that two of these teams; the Buffalo Bills and Minnesota Vikings, have appeared in four Super Bowls, but never won any. The Vikings' last appearance was in 1977.</p><p class=align-left>However, they have appeared in the conference championship game six times since.
